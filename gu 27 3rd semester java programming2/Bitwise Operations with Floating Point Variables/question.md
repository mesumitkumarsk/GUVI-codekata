Bitwise Operations with Floating Point Variables

Problem Statement
Write a program that takes two floating-point numbers as input, performs bitwise operations by converting them to integers, and outputs the results in a specific format.

Description
You need to declare two floating-point variables, convert them to integers, perform the following bitwise operations, and print the results:

Perform bitwise AND on the two integers.
Perform bitwise OR on the two integers.
Perform bitwise XOR on the two integers.
Perform bitwise NOT on the first integer and AND it with the second integer.
Input Format
Two floating-point numbers, each on a new line.

Output Format
Four lines of output, each showing the result of the respective operations in the following format:
Bitwise AND result: <result>
Bitwise OR result: <result>
Bitwise XOR result: <result>
Bitwise NOT and AND result: <result>

Sample Input:
5.5
3.3

Sample Output:
Bitwise AND result: 1
Bitwise OR result: 7
Bitwise XOR result: 6
Bitwise NOT and AND result: 2
