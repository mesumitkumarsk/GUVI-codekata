On Earth, each plane has a special affinity for another plane. Given a group of n planes, numbered from 1 to n, where plane i likes plane fi, we aim to determine if any love triangle exists.

Input:

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — representing the number of planes.

The second line contains n integers f1, f2, ..., fn (1 ≤ fi ≤ n, fi ≠ i), indicating that the i-th plane is fond of plane fi.

Output:

Output "YES" if there exists a love triangle among the planes. Otherwise, output "NO".

Sample input:

5
5 5 5 5 1

Sample output:

NO
